### The Quizbowl Challenge: Models and Evaluation

You should download the QANTA 2018 dataset from https://sites.google.com/view/qanta/resources

In this repo, `train_10.json` and `test_100.json` are sampled examples from the training and test sets. `predictions.json`  `predictions_2sents.json`  `predictions_last_sent.json` are predictions made by three different models (to the questions in `test_100.json`).

For evaluation, run `python evaluate.py`
